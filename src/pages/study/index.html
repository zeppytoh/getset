        <p class="lead">Your first Semester's GPA has a great impact on your 3 years in Poly.</p>
        <p>Why so? There are 2 GPAs - Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA.</p>
    <p>Semester GPA is basically your GPA for a particular Semester. However, the GPA you graduate with looks at your Cumulative GPA. They will factor in <em>all</em> your Semester GPA and come up with an average GPA. So, if you do well for your first Semester, it will greatly help your three years in Polytechnic. If not, it can really pull you down and demotivate you. Also, first Semester tend to be easier as compared to as you progress in your polytechnic education.</p>

        <h4 id="startearly">Start preparation early</h4>
        <p class="lead">As we talk about how your first Semester GPA is important, our advice to you is "start preparation early"!</p>
        <p><strong>Paying attention in lectures and jotting down notes</strong> might help. Sometimes, the lecturers do give hints on topics which might be tested during your examinations, especially in lectures nearing your papers. You might want to focus on them during revision. Coming up with your own abbreviations for certain words might help you follow the pace of your lecturer when taking down notes! 
    </p>
    <hr />
        <h4 id="attendlectures">Attend <em>all</em> lectures, and don't be shy to <em>ask!</em></h4>
        <p class="lead">Don’t understand? Be thick-skinned and ask your lecturers during break, after lecture or during tutorials! In Poly, it's all about taking the initiative.</p>
        <p>Instead of asking your friends, you might want to be thick-skinned and ask your lecturers during break or after lecture or during tutorials just in case your friend might not understand the topic or able to explain it correctly… hearing from your lecturer might be more helpful! Sometimes, we have friends that think they know but actually they don’t… </p>
    
    <p>This is especially true when it comes to projects or assignments given to us by the lecturers. Sometimes, what is expected of us or the questions themselves are not clear. <em>Lecturers are not going to spoon-feed you.</em> It's much better to clear any doubts and expectations before working on assignments, rather than find out you've got it wrong and need to redo part or all of it when you're near the deadline!</p>

    <h2 id="article">&quot;Successful Studying&quot; <small>Article by Dr Steve Douglass</small></h2>
    <p class="lead">Would you like to have more fun at poly? Would you like to get better grades?</p>
    <p>I can probably guess your answer to both of these questions. Who wouldn't want both? The problem is that students often mistakenly believe that the two are mutually exclusive, meaning you can't have it both ways.</p>
    <p>I disagree. I guarantee that if you apply these simple principles, you can have both. Join me in a discussion in the <a href="./assets/img/8020.pdf">next few pages (of this PDF)</a> of how to do just that. Learn how to become what I call an 80/20 Student.</p>
